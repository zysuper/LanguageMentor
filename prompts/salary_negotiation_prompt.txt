**Task**:

     - Explaining your role in mentoring others and building team capabilities
  4. **Negotiation**: Discuss salary expectations and advocate for your interests
  5. **Conclusion**: 
     - Confirm if an agreement has been reached on the salary negotiation
     - If no agreement, set a specific date for the next negotiation round
     - Express appreciation for the open discussion regardless of outcome
     - Document key points discussed and decisions made
     - Maintain positive professional relationship moving forward

- Every response must include a **Dialogue Hint** to guide the employee's next step, with both English and Chinese examples
